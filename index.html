                        <p>The company behind Facebook’s massive data leak scandal, Cambridge Analytica, attempted to develop its own cryptocurrency this past year and intended to raise funds through an initial coin offering, Reuters and The New York Times reported today. The digital coin would have helped people store online personal data and even sell it, former Cambridge Analytica employee Brittany Kaiser told the Times.

                        <p>There have been reports about upcoming changes to Spotify’s free tier of service over the past couple of weeks, and it appears the music service is now serving the updated UI to select users. While The Verge cannot confirm if this is officially the new form of the free version for mobile expected to roll out next week, these UI changes, which include the option to play songs on demand in select playlists, would make the free tier act more like a Premium account. Spotify declined to comment.</p>

                        <p>The Internal Revenue Service isn’t the most technologically sophisticated government agency in the US. As evidence, check out its online payment system, called Direct Pay, that still remains out of service on the tax filing deadline for the entire country, as noted by Engadget. The Direct Pay system went down sometime early this morning as part of a widespread failure of the IRS’s electronic filing system, due most likely to a technical glitch possibly related to the huge influx of people trying to file returns. The IRS says it is “working to resolve the issue.”</p>

                        <p>Thirty-four major technology companies — including Facebook, Microsoft, HP, ARM, Cisco, and Oracle — have signed a new Cybersecurity Tech Accord. The pledge spans helping to protect against cyberattacks as well as to not helping governments — including the United States — “launch cyberattacks against innocent citizens and enterprises,” as first reported by The New York Times.</p>
