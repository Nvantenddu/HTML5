      <p>Between robotic vacuums, voice-activated light switches and virtual assistants, the smart home tech business is booming. As smart home devices are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, a hub from which to control your various gadgets is a good idea. We liked Amazon’s Echo, the device that introduced Alexa, back when it was introduced in 2015 and many improvements have been made in the intervening three years. Amazon Echo is on sale for $84.99 (usually $99.99) and the smaller Echo Dot is down to $39.99 (usually $49.99). These Amazon devices deals end at 11:59 PM ET on Saturday, April 21. An Echo bundle with smart bulbs from TP-Link is on sale as well for $112.24 (usually $144.93).<br><br>

This week, The Verge secured an exclusive deal from Anker on two products from their PowerPort series. The first is a high-speed power delivery hub for USB-C and standard USB devices. Usually $36.99, Verge readers can use the promo code VERGEAA3 to get it for $25.19. Additionally, a PowerPort surge protector with 12 AC outlets and 3 USB ports is $26.99 with promo code VERGEAA4 (usually $34.99).

      <p>AT&T has steadily improved its prepaid phone plans over the past few years, and today, it’s making a few more additions and improvements. The highlight is a new 8GB plan that costs $50 per month, but comes down to $40 per month if you enroll in automatic monthly payments to renew service. While that might not be possible for all customers, it’s not a huge ask since many people will be using the service as a regular, monthly plan anyway.<br><br>

The new 8GB plan more or less replaces the 6GB plan that AT&T used to sell for $45 ($40 with auto pay), though customers will still be able to get it in stores if they want. As long as you’re getting the discount though, there’s no reason not to upgrade, since the new plan has an extra 2GB of data and no downsides. Both plans also support rollover data, allowing you to use any extra data from the prior month.<br><br>

In addition to the 8GB plan, AT&T is also tweaking its $65 unlimited plan by bringing the price down to $55, instead of $60, when customers use auto pay. That plan isn’t exactly unlimited, since you can’t stream HD videos or use tethering. AT&T is also upgrading its somewhat-more-unlimited plan, which costs $85 per month and does include HD video and some tethering, so that it includes 10GB of tethering data instead of just 6GB.<br><br>

Altogether, it doesn’t seem like there’s anything to complain about here. The 8GB plan is basically AT&T’s new general-purpose prepaid data plan; and at that price, it’s a pretty good deal — for comparison: Verizon’s $40 plan only offers 3GB of data.</p>

      <p>The Federal Trade Commission warned this week that mobile spam calls are now targeting the Chinese community in the US, with the robocaller pretending to be from the Chinese Embassy. The messages range from asking the recipient to pick up a package or document from a Chinese Consulate office and offering to exchange yuan to dollars, to the Embassy investigating a fraud and requiring personal information to avoid deportation.<br><br>

The FTC believes these calls are targeting Chinese immigrants or callers with Chinese last names, but in recent weeks, the practice has reached numbers across the US regardless of who the number is registered to. Like other spam calls, the incoming number appear to be similar to the recipient’s own phone number, or spoofs the Chinese Embassy’s real phone number which begins with (212) 244. In addition to calls, the FTC warns that similar scams may also be targeting users via WeChat.<br><br>
          According to the New York Police Department, 21 Chinese immigrants have been scammed out of $2.5 million since December 21, 2017. Seniors make up the majority of the victims, and individual losses range between $1,800 to $1.4 million. Similar scams targeting Chinese immigrants have also hit other countries, including Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.<br><br>

US carriers and phone makers have been working to identify and automatically block spam callers, but if you want to take additional steps to eradicate these annoying calls, here’s a guide to permanently block them from reaching you. But in general, even if some are still getting through, always remember to never share personal information such as full credit card numbers, passwords, bank information, or Social Security numbers, over the phone.</p>

      <p>If you’ve been using Google’s messaging app, Allo, it’s probably a good time to start thinking about switching to something else. The app isn’t getting dropped in a Google-style “Spring Cleaning,” but development on the app is being “paused.” Specifically, the new head of the communications group at Google, Anil Sabharwal, has made the decision to “pause investment” in Allo and move that team over to focus on Android Messages.<br><br>

As we explain in our exclusive feature, the move is necessary because Google is going all in on Rich Communication Services, or RCS. The service will be branded “Chat” once carriers launch it, and Google wants to apply as many resources as possible to make sure that this time, finally, Android has a successful messaging app.<br><br>

Basically, not enough people downloaded and used Allo, so it doesn’t make sense to continue to try to make it a viable competitor to Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp.<br><br>
          If you’re an Allo user, the app will continue to function, and the company is “continuing to support” it in some capacity. Google hasn’t made any final determinations about what to do with the app. “We want to do right by users. We want to make the right decisions here, and we don’t want to rush anything,” Sabharwal says. The urgent need was bringing that team over to support Android Messages, and so that’s happening “immediately.”<br><br>

From Google’s perspective, Sabharwal says that his team is “giving ourselves the time to think of what the right next steps are.” As for what’s next for Allo from your perspective, I recommend you start asking your pals what they’d like to switch to.<br><br>

      <p>Apple’s efforts to diversify its reliance on Samsung as an iPhone display manufacturer has reportedly hit problems. The Wall Street Journal reports that efforts to get LG Display’s OLED screens into the iPhone production line have hit manufacturing issues. Apple is reportedly divided on whether LG will be able to succeed as the second source of OLED displays for the iPhone.<br><br>

Analysts have been warning for months that Apple is in “urgent” need of finding another iPhone OLED supplier besides Samsung. Apple currently uses Samsung’s OLED displays for the company’s iPhone X model. The reliance on a single supplier means Samsung controls pricing on the displays that Apple is buying — and there’s no other alternative at the moment.<br><br>

LG returned to using OLED phone displays for the V30, but the quality of the display wasn’t very good. LG has also been supplying OLED displays for Google’s Pixel 2 XL handset, and it’s been a lottery whether owners get a good display or not. LG is leading in OLED displays for TV sizes, but the company appears to be struggling to bring that experience over to smaller smartphone displays.</p>
